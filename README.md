# fivem_pocketbase

A FiveM resource to communicate with a PocketBase database using [pocketbase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pocketbase).


## ‚ú® Features

- Several CRUD methods for records-related tasks, with more planned in future releases.
- Simple storage and access of JSON data, without the need to encode/decode.
- Access to related tables via `expand` field, similar to MySQL JOINs.
- Added usage examples.


## üìö Installation

- Clone this repository to `fivem_pocketbase` in your FiveM `resources` folder.
- Copy `fivem_pocketbase/database.cfg` to your server root directory.
- Add the following lines to your server config:
```
exec "database.cfg"
start fivem_pocketbase
```
- Change `pocketbase_url`, `pocketbase_useremail`, and `pocketbase_password` in `database.cfg`.
- Run `npm install` in `resources/fivem_pocketbase` directory.


## üëê Credit

I enjoyed playing around with the PocketBase database, and wanted to try to create my own lib in FiveM. I used knowledge, code and patterns from the [fivem-mongodb](https://github.com/nbredikhin/fivem-mongodb) resource to develop this.
